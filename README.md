# Plotly Belly Button Biodiversity Project

## Overview of the Project

Roza is a biological research in a microbiological laboratory. In her role, she is tasked with studying bacterial species to determine if there are any bacterial species that might be used to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Her lab has partnered with Improbably Beef to study bacteria in order to develop plant-based proteins as alternatives to meat. Roza's hypothesis is that there is a microorganism found in the bellybutton that could be used to synthesize these proteins. Roza has sampled the navels of people across the country and collected data on the individuals and the samples. This project will use data visualization tools to display the data collected.
